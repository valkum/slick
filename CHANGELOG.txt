Slick 7.x-1.0-dev, 2014-06-09

Added API file containing skin information.
Added more Views options to have consistent markups with the Field version.

Added optional Colorbox intergration to display image or video inside Colorbox,

Slick 7.x-1.0-dev, 2014-06-07
-----------------------------

Added Sass versions for slick.skin.css and slick.media.css.
Added basic skins to support various slide layouts.
Added direct layout options for core Image field. Media and Field collection
  should use a separate field instead with some pre-defined options.
Added slick.make file to download relevant libraries. We don't name it.example
  to allow simplytest.me download the library.
Added title, captions and overlay fields for Field Collection and Media
Added options to break down Media and Field collection fields to support custom
  displays for slide title, description, overlay audio/video/image, link, and
  layout fields.
Added supports for Field collection at slick_fields.module.
Added Picture module integration.

Slick 7.x-1.0-dev, 2014-05-25
-----------------------------
Added admin CSS and JS to make nice CTools UI.
Added responsive display options, and additional custom options.
Added slick.media.js to allow image to iframe switcher.
Reworked JS settings in the head to only output base defaults alone, with no
  extra items. Individual JS settings are stored as data attributes, only single
  one now.
Reworked the theme functions to merge HTML5 data attributes to store JS settings
  as a single JSON object within the Slick container rather than regular JS
  settings in the <head>.
Simplified logic at module slick.js. JS should not do hard work with typecast
  or parse separate multiple data attributes, PHP does. JS is now ready to
  consume valid JSON object, or nothing. This is relevant where bunch of JS
  settings with responsive displays get in.
Renamed module slick.js into slick.load.js, to avoid conflict with the library
  for debug purposes.
Renamed slick.css into slick.skin.css, otherwise Drupal overrides the library.
Renamed "theme" directory into "templates" for Drupal 8 auto discovery goodness.
Deprecating theme_carousel in favor of theme_slick. Will deprecate it, not yet.
Deleted slick.views.inc and slick_plugin_style_slick.inc files, and use a
  separate slick_views.module instead.

Added CTools plugin for exportable configuration via optionsets.
Added dependencies on CTools, and libraries modules at slick.info file.
Added supports for Image, and Media at slick_fields.module.
Added 2 sub-modules: slick_views and slick_fields.
Added slick.install to install database table for optionsets.
Added the file CHANGELOG.txt.
by gausarts: Reworked some architecture.
